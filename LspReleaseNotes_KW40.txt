2. HowTo build
===============
	This release was built using SDK 5.0
	get linux-2.6.35.9 from www.kernel.org
	change its name to the release name (linux-2.6.35.9-armada370-...).
	unzip the release.zip in the directory where you put the kernel, say A to replace all.
	define ARCH & CROSS_COMPILE env variables
	'export ARCH=arm'
	'export CROSS_COMPILE=<compiler name>'
	cd to the kernel directory.
	'make mrproper'
	config the kernel:
	'make <platform>_defconfig' 
	'make uImage'
	the kernel uImage will be found under arch/arm/boot/.
